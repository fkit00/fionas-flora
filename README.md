# Fiona's Flora :seedling:
Hi i'm fiona, a junior web developer who put down all web development for a few weeks and now needs to ease myself back into it!

## The plan(t)
This repo is for my efforts in making a full stack plant care app. I will be using a PERN stack, and trying to focus more on the user experince and design of the app (as it's not my strong suit). I also want to make sure this app is fully tested, and will be using jest, supertest and hopefully cypress if it plays nice.

### The backend
The backend - also known as the fun bit, will be made with express, cors and postgreSQL. My data shape is really important to the in shaping the apps purpose and is the first thing i need to figure out when making the table. 

### The frontend 
The front end- i will be designing (actually wireframing for once even though it's painful). I'd like a bit of pizzaz so while it should be clean, clear and mobile friendly, i have to figure out how to get a bit of funk into there. I'll have drop down options, and a custom add field. When all items are selected there will be an add plant button, which will assemble the object and send to the database. I'd like to make plant alerts for watering which will mean that i have to acess user timestamp, add that with a last watered section and a how often it need to be watered in order to send the alert. 

### Things i need to watch out for
My last project was in Next.js and i haven't played around with react router yet 
I really struggle with design, so i'm just going to chill out and play around with it 

#### The stretch 
I want to use auth0 so i can have individual accounts - I think by having drop downs on the front/ also an option to make a custom, starting off with an empty table on the backend isn't a problem which should make individal accounts easier
